## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See active states of the images with proper animation

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Expanding Cards]()

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This serves as a practice to expand my HTML and CSS (as well as some minor JS) skills. I've learned how to use the forEach method on DOM elements, and apply animation on it.

### Continued development

I will continue the 50 day - 50 projects, so that I'm more equipped in creating components and layouts on the webpage and have a solid grasp of fundamentals and advance concepts in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I will also apply and modify this component in the future in some other websites that I'll make.
